/home/SHARED/software/anaconda3/2020.07e/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pandas/core/internals/blocks.py:867: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.
